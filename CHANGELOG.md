# V2.0 Dynamic Scaling ESM Version

## V2.0.7 Changes
* Added Pirate/Crimson Fleet Combat Faction (Does not apply to the crimson fleet quest zones)
* Added a new global variables to disable Damage, Health, and XP (Coming Soon) scaling it does not apply to iCalcLevelAdjustUp/iCalcLevelAdjustDown or Low Level NPC they are required for NPC level scaling.

* Factions remaining to convert: Varuun, Starborn, Syndicate, Creatures, Tough Creatures, Terrormorphs, Elder Terrormorphs, The First

## V2.0.6 Changes
* Dropped the recruit/apprentice tags they were just for testing. Keeping the Master tag as that starts a boost to health/resists
* Added ecliptic faction
* The infinite scaling NPCs (last in tree) have unique names for example spaces is Spacer Legend and Ecliptic is Ecliptic Commander
* The syndicate faction will be VERY VERY experimental I'm going to use it to try to fix the level scaling backend BGS disabled
* Fixed a typo in the math formula that adjusts damage for armor resistance making it 3 times stronger then it should have been 
* NOTE: I still need to tune the scale factors for the new high level NPCs. 
* Factions remaining to convert: Pirate, Varuun, Starborn, Syndicate, Creatures, Tough Creatures, Terrormorphs, Elder Terrormorphs, The First
